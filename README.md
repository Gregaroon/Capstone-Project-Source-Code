# Capstone-Project-Source-Code
Source Code for Capstone Project
This repository hosts the source code for our capstone project class.
This may contain code, design documentation, or even cad drawings.
Any pieces of code, even if they are simple brainstorm ideas can be found here. Documentation will hopefully be uploaded to here at some point and will be kept updated with current expectations.

The purpose of this project is to create a sip-puff device for a handicapped individual to give them access to a computer.
